Friendship's embrace, a bond so true,
Through thick and thin, it sees us through.
Laughter shared and tears consoled,
In each other's hearts, we find our gold.

With shared secrets and dreams, they light our way,
In their company, troubles seem to fade and sway.

A comforting presence in times of despair,
With them, life's burdens become easier to bear.

Friendship, a bond so true and rare,
Through highs and lows, they always care.
